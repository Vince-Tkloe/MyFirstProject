**Welcome to My Website!**

Hi there! I’m Vincent Tamakloe, a PhD student in Plant Sciences with a concentration in Applied Chemical Ecology at the University of Vermont. My research focuses on sustainable pest management, particularly exploring pheromone mating disruption in the swede midge (*Contarinia nasturtii*), and I'm passionate about agroecology, plant-insect interactions, chemical ecology, insecticides and pest management.

This site is still under construction, but I’m excited to share my research journey, insights, and updates as I go. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride! Stay tuned for new content and feel free to check back regularly as the site evolves.
